# Group-2---Kruskal-s-Algorithm-Project
Project Overview
This project implements Kruskal’s Algorithm  as an interactive web application. It is designed to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a user-defined weighted graph. This project fulfills the requirement for a group of five (5) to deploy a technical solution via the web.


**Features**
Interactive Canvas: Click to create nodes; drag to create weighted edges.
Step-by-Step Visualization: Watch the algorithm sort edges and select them based on greedy logic.
Cycle Detection: Visual feedback (Green for inclusion, Red for discarded) using the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure.
Live Metrics: Real-time calculation of the total MST weight.

**How to Run**
Locally: Open index.html in any modern web browser.
Web: Visit our live deployment at: [https://sarhbanhu2319.github.io/Group-2---Kruskal-s-Algorithm-Project/]

**Technical Implementation**
Language: JavaScript (Vanilla)
Rendering: HTML5 Canvas API
Data Structure: Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for efficient find and union operations.

**Group 2 Members & Roles**
As a group of five, the responsibilities were divided as follows:

1. **[Salma Banhu ] (Coordinator):** Combined all code in VS Code and hosted the project on the web.
2. **[Shammah ] (Designer):** Created the buttons and the website layout.
3. **[Member 3] (Logic):** Programmed the sorting of the weights.
4. **[Member 4] (Visuals):** Handled the color-coded animations for the graph.
5. **[Member 5] (Tester):** Verified the algorithm results and wrote the project description.

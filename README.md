# Group-2---Kruskal-s-Algorithm-Project
This project is an interactive web-based application designed to demonstrate Kruskal’s Algorithm, a greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a connected weighted graph. The goal of the algorithm is to connect all nodes in a graph with the lowest possible total edge weight without forming any cycles.
